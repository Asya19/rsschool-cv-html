### __About me:__

+ My goal is to become a frontend-developer ( by the Senior level);
+ My priority is to study JS up to the middle level;

While working in fast food, I got acquainted with the C# programming language during courses. I studied the backend. During the courses, we had projects: a CRM system and "Point". It was hard for me to study the Backend, but I really liked writing code (especially working) and creating incredible things with it. When we were making a CRM system, we touched on the topic of frontend development a little, but at that time everything was unclear. But this topic seemed to me more interesting, so I gave up trying to study the backend. I took courses on creating websites on Tilda and went freelance. But my desire to be a programmer and write code was stronger and I went to college to become a web programmer. Creating a website based on my layout using code has become much more interesting than in the constructor.

I'm glad that now I can combine what I like and what I get.

  let pos = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {

    if(input[i] > 0) 
      pos.push(input[i]);
    else 
      sum += input[i];
  }
      return [pos.length, sum];
}
